An Automatic Tab Grouping Extension for Your Browser.
Tabius is a customizable and easy to use Tab Grouping assistant for Chrome.

If you use tab grouping or couldn't use it due to lack of options, Tabius is a must have extension for you.
The extension is packed with useful features like:

- Automatically create new tab groups when you open a link in a new tab.
- Auto Collapse inactive tab groups.
- Limit the browser to only create groups if the new tab matches the original tab's domain.
- Create custom tab grouping rules: always create tab groups with a specific name and color from your favorite websites!
- Save your favorite tab groups and restore them for later use!
- Don't want to create tab groups from a specific site? Create a blacklist from the settings or add the site to the blacklist right from the toolbar!
- Option to close an existing tab group when there is only 1 tab left in it.
- Limit maximum number of tabs allowed in a group.
- Automatically name tab groups based on domain/subdomain or the full URL.
- View current tab groups and act upon them by clicking on the extension icon right from the toolbar.
- Sync all your settings, tab groups, and custom lists with browser.
- ..and many more features.

I created this extension from my need. I use tab groups all the time and the extension helps enhance this feature.
